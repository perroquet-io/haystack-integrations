Chainlit is an open-source Python package that makes it incredibly fast to build, test and share LLM apps. Integrate the Chainlit API in your existing code to spawn a ChatGPT-like interface in minutes. With a simple line of code, you can leverage Chainlit to interact with your agent, visualise intermediary steps, debug them in an advanced prompt playground and share your app to collect human feedback. More info on the [documentation](https://docs.chainlit.io/).

## Installation

```bash
pip install chainlit
```

## Usage

Create a new Python file named `app.py` with the code below. This code adds the Chainlit callback handler to the Haystack callback manager. The callback handler is responsible for listening to the Agentâ€™s intermediate steps and sending them to the UI.

```python
from haystack.agents.conversational import ConversationalAgent
import chainlit as cl

## Agent Code

agent = ConversationalAgent(
  prompt_node=conversational_agent_prompt_node,
  memory=memory,
  prompt_template=agent_prompt,
  tools=[search_tool],
)

cl.HaystackAgentCallbackHandler(agent)

@cl.on_message
async def main(message: str):
    response = await cl.make_async(agent.run)(message)
    await cl.Message(author="Agent", content=response["answers"][0].answer).send()
```

To kick off your LLM app, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `app.py`, and run the following command:

```bash
chainlit run app.py
```
